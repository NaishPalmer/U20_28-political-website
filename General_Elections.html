    <h1>When are General Elections?</h1>
    <p class="content-text">When Parliament is dissolved every seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant and a general election is held. Each constituency in the UK elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to a seat in the House of Commons. Usually the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons forms the Government.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> </p>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>What is a General Election?</h1>
    <p class="content-text">A general election is an opportunity for people in every part of the UK to choose their MP - the person who will represent their local area (constituency) in the House of Commons for up to five years.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="content-text">There is normally a choice of several candidates in each constituency, some of which are the local candidates for national political parties. People can only vote for one of the candidates and the candidate that receives most votes becomes their MP.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>When was the last General Election?</h1>
    <p class="content-text">The date of the last general election was 8 June 2017. </p>
    <p class="content-text">The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets the interval between general elections at five years. At the end of this time a new House of Commons must be elected.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="content-text">However, there are two provisions that trigger an election other than at five year intervals: <sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <ul class="ul-content">
      <li class="li-content">a motion of no confidence is passed in Her Majesty's Government by a simple majority and 14 days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed</li>
      <li class="li-content">a motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats (currently 434 out of 650)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>  
    <p class="content-text">The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 provides for general elections to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years <sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="content-text">Previous to this Act, the Prime Minister could call a general election at any time within the five year period and not all Parliaments lasted the full five years.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="content-text">Before 2011 a general election could be called earlier for a number of reasons. For example, the Prime Minister could decide to call an election at a time when he or she was most confident of winning the election (getting more MPs than any other party) or if a government was defeated on a confidence motion, a general election could follow. <sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>

    <h1>Who becomes Prime Minister?</h1>
    <h2>Can I vote for a new Prime Minister? </h2>
    <p class="content-text">No. You can only vote to elect your local MP in a general election. Even if you live in the constituency represented by the current Prime Minister or the leader of another political party, you are still only voting on whether he or she will be your local MP in the next Parliament.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <h2>Who chooses the Prime Minister? </h2>
