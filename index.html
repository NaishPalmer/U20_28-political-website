      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p class="content-text">This website is designed to be source of information regarding the United Kingdom's Political system.  </p> 
      <p class="content-text">The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch. A king or queen is the head of state, and a prime minister is the head of government. The people vote in elections for Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent them.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121003074658/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073438" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>

      <h1>What is Parliment?</h1> 
       <p class="content-text">
          Parliament is there to represent our interests and make sure they are taken into account by the Government. The Government cannot make new laws or raise new taxes without Parliamentâ€™s agreement. 
          Parliament is made up of people we have elected and people who have been appointed. They sit in two separate Houses:<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/parliament-government/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> 
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-content">
          <li class="li-content">The House of Commons, where all the people we have elected at the General Election work, as MPs, for the next five years. This includes people in other political parties, as well as those in the winning party who were not chosen to be ministers.</li>
          <li class="li-content">The House of Lords, whose members are mostly appointed for life rather than elected. They have often been chosen because of their achievements and experience. Many do not belong to a political party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-text">
            Government ministers also have seats in Parliament but most of their work is done in Government departments.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/parliament-government/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>

      <h1>What is The House of Commons?</h1> 
       <p class="content-text">
        Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected every five years at a General Election. For the purposes of the General Election, the country is divided into 650 constituencies or areas. Each constituency elects one MP to Parliament. The last General Election was in 2015.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup></p>
        <p>At the 2015 General Election Scotland returned 59 MPs. 56 of the 59 MPs elected were from the Scottish National Party (SNP). There was also one Conservative, one Labour and one Liberal Democrat.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> </p>
        
        <p>One role of MPs in the UK Parliament is to represent their constituents in areas where the UK Parliament takes decisions eg immigration or defence. MPs either debate or ask questions in the House of Commons or they work in smaller groups known as committees.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> </p> </p>
        
        <p>Other important roles of MPs in Parliament are to help make laws and to scrutinise (check-up on) the work of the government or investigate issues.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> </p></p>

      <h1>What is The House of Lords?</h1> 
      <p>The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. The role of the House of Lords is to help make laws as well as check-on the work of government and investigate issues.<sup><a class="reference" id="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> </p>
      <p>Most peers have been appointed by the Queen on the advice of a prime minister in recognition of their expertise in a particular area eg business, law or science. Others are Church of England bishops and 92 are hereditary peers or people with titles (such as Barons or Viscounts) who have inherited the right to sit in the Lords.<sup><a class="reference" href="https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zwvqtfr/revision/2" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> </p>
