      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p class="content-text">The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW; Welsh: Plaid Werdd Cymru a Lloegr) is a green, left-wing political party in England and Wales. Headquartered in London, since September 2018, its Co-Leaders are Si√¢n Berry and Jonathan Bartley. The Green Party has one Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, one representative in the House of Lords, and three Members of the European Parliament. It has various councillors in UK local government and two members of the London Assembly.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">The party's ideology combines environmentalism with left-wing economic policies, including well-funded, locally controlled public services within the confines of a steady state economy, and it supports proportional representation.[16] It also takes a progressive approach to social policies such as civil liberties, animal rights, LGBT rights and drug policy reform. The party also believes strongly in nonviolence, basic income, a living wage, and democratic participation. The party comprises various regional divisions, including the semi-autonomous Wales Green Party. Internationally, the party is affiliated to the Global Greens and the European Green Party.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        The Green Party of England and Wales was established in 1990 alongside the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland through the division of the pre-existing Green Party, a group which had originally been established as the PEOPLE Party in 1973. Experiencing centralising reforms spearheaded by the Green 2000 group in the early 1990s, the party sought to emphasise growth in local governance, doing so throughout the 1990s. In 2010, the party gained its first MP in Lucas, who represents the constituency of Brighton Pavilion.
